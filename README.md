SimplyChat-iOS
==============

A simple chat app for iPhone.

SimplyChat is a real-time chat application for iOS. It's a native app written in Objective-C. I wrote the backend as a REST service running on Node.js and MongoDb ([here](https://github.com/jrusev/SimplyChat-server)). For the moment the app has only the basic functionality, but I will develop it into a more polished app with features such as group chat, photo messages, etc.
